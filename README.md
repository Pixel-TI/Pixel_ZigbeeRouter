# Hello World with ZigBee Router

## Introduction

>This project is aimed at people who are having their first contact with the system, and want to get a sense of how the programming for Silicon Labs chips works.
The device in this example only receives ZigBee On/Off commands and has one input (the button) and two digital outputs (LEDs).

NOTE: This base design is for the **EFR32MG13P732F512GM48** chip.


## Installation

>There are two ways to import, using the MCU file (.sls) or the entire project folder. In the case of this example we will use the MCU file.

>>1- After installing the development environment, import the project: Files -> Import...; 

>>2- Select the import option: More Import Options...;

>>3- Add To import the entire project folder, select: Simplicity Studio -> MCU Project;

>>4- Go to the folder where you cloned this repository and select the Pixel_ZigbeeRouter.sls file.
